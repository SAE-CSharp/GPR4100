             * An array is a collection of variables of the same type.

             * They are referred to by a common name.

             * Arrays organise data in such a way that it can be easily manipulated and stored.

             * All variables stored in an array must be of the same data type (e.g. string, int, char).

             * Stored in sequential and ordered manner.

             * Square brackets [] after the variable decleration (e.g. int []) let the compiler know
               that this is an array variable (instead of normal variable).

             * Array index always starts at zero

             * The difference between array and enumerator:
                Array is a value
                Enumeration is a type

             * Once you specify size of array it can't be changed but you can change values of elements
